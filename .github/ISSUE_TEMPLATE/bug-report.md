-->
- [ ] I have read the above note

#### What version of Round Sync are you using (About -> App version)?
<!-- Example: 2.1.0 -->


#### What is your Android version, phone model and manufacturer?
<!-- Example: Android 11, Google Pixel 5 -->



#### Which steps are required to reproduce this issue?

Example:
  1. Open a remote
  2. Select "Delete" on a folder
  3. Round Sync crashes 

Please also enable rclone logging (Settings > Logging > Log Rclone errors). You're going to need the log for the last question.


#### What is your configuration (`rclone.conf`)?
<!-- REDACT any pass =, token =, key =, secret = etc. before posting!                   -->
<!-- You can get that file by exporting your configuration.                             -->
<!--        v2.2.2: Open the navigation drawer, click export                            -->
<!--        later version: Open the navigation drawer, click settings, click export     -->
<!--        Now, open the zip-file, read the rclone.conf and upload the redacted content-->

#### Does the same issue also occur when using the same configuration on a PC or in Termux?
<!-- Export your configuration and test if the problem also happens elsewhere. -->
